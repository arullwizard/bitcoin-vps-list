Last update: 23 December 2022
Regularly updated list of Bitcoin-friendly VPS, dedicated server, VDS, VPN, and email providers.

Fight for Bitcoin privacy! The United Nations, the United States, the European Union (Russia & China too) are waging a global war on Bitcoin and crypto privacy. KYC harms innocent people and is useless against real criminals. It may even encourage new forms of crime! If these trends continue, many privacy-friendly server providers on this page would likely have to shut down or require you to provide huge amounts of personal information. But it's not too late to stop it. Tell your government that this will kill your access to the world's fastest-growing industry while imposing massive costs that bring almost no benefits. Please support people like Patrick Hansen (Unstoppable Finance), Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party), and CoinCenter who are fighting against these insane ideas. And remember, privacy-hostile KYC didn't prevent the FTX collapse!

Search providers by location: locations are tagged by ISO country code. You can search by pressing Ctrl-F/Cmd-F, enabling case sensitive/"match case" in the dialog box, and searching in the page text for e.g RO to find all providers with locations in Romania. 2-letter country codes are listed here.

Make sure to include server and company locations. If they use BitPay please flag this. Additional notes (what level of anonymity is allowed at signup, whether they offer block storage / are suited to running Bitcoin full nodes, etc) are welcome. Particularly interested in hosts that take Lightning payments and hosts in exotic locations.

Using BitPay or using providers that require it is strongly discouraged: many readers have complained BitPay requires a separate account and extensive personal information from the customer in order to pay for services from BitPay-using merchants. Commonly recommended alternative payment providers include BTCPayServer, Coinify, Coingate, and CoinPayments.net. Blockonomics.co and accepting-bitcoin.org may also be worth looking at.

Privacy policy/Disclaimers: This website doesn't use cookies. It does log IP addresses (so use Tor Browser). It sometimes uses affiliate links.

Hat tip to joepie91 for creating the first list.

"You know that whole NSA story from almost ten years ago? I paid for the servers that made that possible... using Bitcoin." --Edward Snowden

VDS providers
Virtual Dedicated Server providers, which are very similar to VPS providers but sometimes offer greater isolation (e.g using KVM or Xen instead of OpenVZ -- note many VPS providers also offer KVM or Xen). In some cases VDS may mean a VPS with a dedicated CPU core, so it is not sharing CPU capacity with other clients from that provider.
